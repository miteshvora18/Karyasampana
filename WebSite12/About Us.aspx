Our mission is to support the Hindu devotees across India and the world to achieve their spiritual goals, and be closer to the God.
                            
As a Devout Hindu living abroad, I found it increasingly hard to follow my heart and and spiritual needs. Visiting holy places like Vaishno Devi, Siddhi Vinayak and Tirupathi had to be fitted around tight holiday schedules rather than being planned as per my spiritual needs. Being a professional in a foreign location, getting a holiday to coincide with special personal occasions as well as during important religious dates became especially hard for me. I had to make do with holding off my plans till my next visit back home.

                                           By the end of 2012, I managed to visit Vaishno Devi and Siddhi Vinayak, while Tirupathi has been scheduled for my next visit. This desire also germinated into a thought that, I can make it easier for fellow Indians who are facing similar challenge, by conducting Pujas at the holy locations on their behalf. This site and the offering is the materialisation of that thought process.
